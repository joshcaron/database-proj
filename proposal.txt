Description:
  We intend to design a system for keeping track of permissions that users have
  on resources. The system will understand 'Resources' as entities a user may act
  upon, 'Permissions' as performable actions, 'Groups' as sets of users and
  groups, and 'Users' as the entity that can perform actions. We will have an
  web front end that will allow a user to assign users and groups to groups, and
  create 'Permission Sets', which bind together a Resource, Group and Permission
  with either and explicit deny or allow.
Technologies: PHP, JQuery, Bootstrap.
Interest: This project is a problem we have systems handle poorly before (for
instance, ApacheShiro or ASP.net Membership), and it would be nice to see it
done correctly for once.
